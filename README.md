## Project Engineering

This project makes use of the stacked framework as it's source of engineering and principles and was generated using the Stacked CLI. Kindly read about stacked [here](https://stacked.filledstacks.com/)

## Implementation Assumptions

- When implenting the scroll user experince of this application, what came to mind where, what are the quick sections that needs to be seen by the user to make descions on the fly and what are the sections that need to be in the scroll element.

- Secondly, I thought about the view port and directionality of the scrolling widgets. We have a vertical and horizontal scroll which in my days of implementing are a tricky bit. For that, I employed custom scroll view to allow for cleaner and safe implementation.
